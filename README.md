## Questions

**What is the most influential book or blog post youâ€™ve read regarding web
development?**

Clean code by Bob Martin has had the most influence on my code style.  Otherwise
it would be a [talk given by Maile Ohye in 2016](https://wordpress.tv/2016/12/11/maile-ohye-a-view-from-google-the-latest-in-google-and-google/) on the importance of making web
pages light weight. It's safe to say that my focus the last couple of years has
been to write clean simple code and to keep page loads as lean as possible.

**Tell me about a web application you have built. Why did you choose to build it?
What did you learn? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?**

I chose to build the [wine journal](https://ourwinejournal.com) project because
I'm interested in small scale, private social networking.  So the goal was to
build an app where friends and family could share information about wine.

I had a couple of big goals when I began the project.  The first was to learn how
to use Flask blueprints to organize an application.  The second was to
expirement with image upload and manipulation.  Incorporating these into the app
were probably my 2 greatest challenges.

Implementing these features required a lot of independent learning and
expirementation.  I literally spent 2 months learning how to use Flask blueprints
and experimenting with various blueprint configurations.  I didn't just want to
build an app, I wanted to build it the way a seasoned professional would build it.

I had to teach myself image upload, manipulation, and storage on Amazon S3 from
scratch. In the course of reading documentation and experimentation I learned
how to upload, resize, rotate, crop, compress and store images on S3.  The allows
the users of the app to upload photos from their phones and makes the sharing
experience more visual.

**Write a function in Python that takes a list of strings and returns a single
string that is an HTML unordered list of those strings.
You should include a brief explanation of your code. Then, what would you have
to consider if the original list was provided by user input?**

See problem1.py.  If this were user generated content then you would need to
sanitize the input data, using something like the Python library "bleach".

**List 2-3 attacks that web applications are vulnerable to. How do these attacks
work? How can we prevent those attacks?**

**XXS - Cross site scripting** This form of attack allows a maliscious user to use
a form to add script to a page that will perform some nefarious act when another
visitor to that page does something on that page.

**CSRF - Cross site request forgery**

**Here is some starter code for a Flask Web Application. Expand on that and
include a route that simulates rolling two dice and returns the result in JSON.
You should include a brief explanation of your code.**

**If you were to start your full-stack developer position today, what would be
your goals a year from now?**
